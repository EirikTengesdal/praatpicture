Description: Quickly and easily generate plots of acoustic data aligned with transcriptions similar to those made in Praat. Default settings and options are designed to be emulate those used by Praat. Waveforms and spectrograms can be plotted from sound files alone; TextGrids, intensity curves, formants, and pitch curves can be plotted if Praat files are provided.
